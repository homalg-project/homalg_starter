The homalg starter

HowTo:
1. Copy init_homalg_starter.SAMPLE to init_homalg_starter, make it executable and modify the paths.
2. Run create_homalg_starter.
3. Use your new gap start script.

If you want to have the starter checked for modifications in the git status rather than in the PackageInfo.g, you need to run the *_git commands instead.
